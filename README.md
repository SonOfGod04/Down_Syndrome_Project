# Down_Syndrome_Project
Down syndrome is a genetic disorder and results from having an extra copy of the 21st chromosome. In this case, the sum of the chromosomes, which is normally 46, increases to 47. This extra genetic material causes the physical and developmental characteristics associated with Down syndrome.
